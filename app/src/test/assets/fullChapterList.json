She was walking in and David was a bit lower.. in plane or something.  They weren?t standing on the exact same platform is what I?m trying to say.. so that?s why David looks shorter.. he?s just closer to us.

It was created by an ex-friend while we were Skyping one time and I was reading through random webcomics.. and I found one that was all.. kind of generic and yaoi-filled. And he was all ?You should totally make a gay character in your comic for equality purposes!!? and I was all ?.. ok?</p><p> THIS WAS NOT A VERY GOOD IDEA IN RETROSPECT</p><p>So yeah, I absolutely deeply apologise for this in retrospect. This comic appears in volume one and I still regret it immensely, especially as I've gotten flack for something that wasn't even really my idea in the first place. I take full responsibility for drawing it, but I would have never made a character like this in the first place. He appears in a few later chapters in volume one, but he's basically eliminated volume 2 and on.</p><p>So yeah, I'm very very sorry to anyone who felt intensely bothered by the earliest LGBT character to be a piece of garbage. He was not my creation, yet he was an error on my part. There were a lot of fancharacters I added back when I was totally accepting of them that I feel icky about now, this is one of those particularly strong and special cases. This is a bad character and it shouldn't have existed and is detrimental to the comic and once again, I am very sorry.</p><p>There might be a few cute jokes here and there like Lucy's thumbs up, but still. Yuck. Bad character made by bad person. Sorry. </p>"

I had to do some assignments this week and I ended up not having enough time to get this week?s installment done.  Hence why I?m posting filler now.  I?m terribly sorry about that.. I was only able to get to the sixth page of the plot comic.. but there is DEFINITELY a lot more waiting.. I either had to give up or vomit out a half-assed comic.</p><p>Then again my comics are always half-assed lolllll</p><p>Anyway.. yeah.  I hope this proves entertaining nonetheless!</p><p>This comic is actually meant to be a revived version of a comic I did back in the old series. I will probably show the original pages in the future when I get a gallery section working.. but for now, here?s the newer version! I hope this is amusing enough for you guys.. let?s get on with the show!</p><p>Lucy is an epic internets user. Also, for those geeky enough to notice at first glance.. yes.. one of the most dreaded things ever..</p><p>Lucy owns a Mac.</p><p>..</p><p>No, Souppy did not force me to do this.</p><p>Coo Coo Charms is an old brand I?ve been using.. as old as the old series. I think that goes on par with ?Blasto Soda?.. which hasn?t been shown in this series yet.. but those are just the brands I used to use. Pretty silly names, huh? Lily has been the type to enjoy collection Coo Coo Charms prizes.. something that hasn?t changed. </p>"

She definitely shows off more of her ?inner personality? when in the safety of her own home.. just a silly little corcerned worry-wart. This reminds me.. I think I?ve drawn Lucy particularly.. curvy throughout this. I mean.. she is already.. but I?ve definitely made it show more.. I guess that happens when Lucy gets a massive amount of screentime. Which is weird to say since she?s one of the biggest main characters. Poor thing.</p>"

Her first time appearing in an ooolllddd flashback.. she still retains her pearl necklace.. Daisy?s got herself a rival. *Hit*</p><p>The moment has finally arrived.

I mean if people wanna talk about the most recent pages, they got the comments section here.. so anything else could be at the forum, but are there enough readers to make that something plausible to do?

Instead, I?ll use this post to quickly explain WHAT TOOK SO LONG</p><p>The site is now running on a new server, one of Joyent?s new Solaris things. So it should be faster and nicer! More importantly, I took this opportunity to add a few things to the site. You?ll notice that your comments are automatically converted into <strong>proper punctuation</strong> (smart quotes), that <strong>badly written tags</strong> aren?t going to break the layout anymore, and that links are <strong>automatically linkified</strong>. Also, once we get <strong>more than 15 comments</strong>, some will be hidden so the page loads faster and is easier to catch up on?but don?t be discouraged from commenting, the last five comments are always visible and an Expand button makes everything appear instantly! You?ll also notice there?s a <strong>voting link section</strong> for you to patronise. Try it out! If you wonderful people can click daily, perhaps we?ll get a lot of hits out of it.. so in exchange, we?ll start posting <strong>incentive sketches</strong> on the Top Webcomics site. Besides all this, there?s a <strong>special iPhone</strong> (and other similar touchscreen device) <strong>version of the site</strong> only visible from such devices, please check it out. It?s a good way to catch up on chapters in the archive, as it loads a bunch of pages at once. Beside all this, there have been a few minor tweaks to pages in the archive, though nothing of consequence. There?s more to do on the site (specifically, fixing RSS, adding a forum, adding comments support to the iPhone version, and other things) but this should tide you over for now ? and make comments a lot nicer to use.</p><p>Anyway, enjoy the first page of the chapter. It?s a good one! ?SuitCase</p>"

In fact, if you have anything with a separate IP address (i.e. access to a computer at work, or school, or your internet-enabled phone) you can vote several times in each day and really help us!</p><p>Another thing for you to remember (besides <strong>COME BACK EVERY DAY</strong>) is that if you miss a day, you miss a page of the comic?so you can?t miss a few days and catch up later! In order to make it fairer for readers we pick up during the month, we may post previous pages later on, but only if we?re at 10 or lower in the rankings. Otherwise what?s the point of posting every day, right?</p><p>Your help throughout the next month will be totally appreciated?we know it?s a bit annoying to do the vote dance every day, but hopefully the upcoming comic (even if it?s of sketchy quality) will make up for it and give you an interesting story you wouldn?t have got otherwise. We want to pick up a ton of new readers this month and making it up there on TWC will help out so much.</p><p>The final regular incentive has been posted.

Lucy has two biological brothers, and none of them are younger than her. That is why she is saying that it must be nice having someone younger to take care of, and Mike is saying bluntly that she is speaking nonsense because taking care of Yashy and the other pets is similar to taking care of Chris.</p><p>Funfact, this is the FIRST TIME Haley has ever been referenced in comic, and I know in my descriptions i have always called her Hayley. I hated that. I always preferred Haley, and at the end of the day, the comic itself is what points out the correct spelling so Haley is canon and you should ignore the past me and my durpitude!</p><p>EDIT: People were too confused by it and I was too annoyed with the dialogue, so it has been altered to just Mike being blunt and snarky!

				"description": "<p>New chapter, guys! Yay!!! I feel sorta bad because I initially wanted the weekday updates to begin today (Mainly as a reward for you guys making me win the Mix March Madness thing like seriously I can?t get over how that happened and I am still surprised and everything and thank you i love you) because I think this page is better off with the next page seen right away and I?m hella nervous about it, but whatchugonnado. I sorta ran out of time to be able to make enough buffer to survive May, so I guess you get a month of crazy ol? cliffhangers with days between them. Of course, we?re still in line to start the five-days-a-week thing in June.</p><p>I?m gonna level with you guys, 2012-2013 was kind of an awkward bad time for me. I did imply multiple times on twitter and even in the page comments how I haven?t been in the best of mindsets. I was even diagnosed with BPD at the end of 2012 which sort of explained A LOT and I really am working on my emotions and trying to be better, one step at a time. Kind of sucks that no medication worked for me so I really just gotta.. deal with it.</p><p>But anyway the point I?m trying to make (I don?t wanna attract a pity party I?m sorry if it comes off that way) is that I really considered ending the comic in 2012 and was trying to think which chapter was good enough as a sudden ending. I was sick of it all, I was extremely upset and I didn?t think it was going anywhere (worrying that Souppy is putting all his effort behind.. a series that won?t pay off. This is our job, after all, so worrying about readership numbers staying at the same level for a year was a huge concern for me and admittedly still is), so when I was planning an <em>ending</em> I thought that this chapter was actually a ?good enough? way to end it. It would leave a lot of questions unanswered, but it just felt like an ending. So yeah, if I was in a worse headspace and really didn?t think BCB was going anywhere, I woulda said this was the final chapter.</p><p>But I was given hope, I guess, so I do have to thank you all for the support. I know I?m a dumb whiny baby a lot of the time and I appear really ungrateful (?WHY DOESN?T ANYONE LIKE ME LET ME SAY THIS WHILE I GET TONS OF TWITTER MESSAGES A DAY ABOUT PEOPLE TELLING ME HOW THEY LIKE ME AND I GET NAGGED BY FRIENDS TO GET ON SKYPE BECAUSE THEY WANNA TALK TO ME?), but I really do thank you lots of the things you?ve done for me, whether it?s reading, donating or subscribing to BCI, visiting me at cons, being super cool, etc, and it?s because of that that Souppy and I are trying super hard to make this year really good for BCB, weekday schedule and moving to America and all</p><p>I do still worry like I wonder if I should start another story or make another story on the side, but yeah. Comic will continue until the actual proper ending that was intended, rather than just a warped crummy end. Show must go on!!!!</p><p>so anyway how about dem cats</p>"

It?s the stuff that happened in Degrassi a lot (half of the graduates in that show were either in a band or in a movie or modelling and it was really silly) so this was more of a parody of that.</p><p>But having the first page up for a few days could make people think I was actually being serious and like ?WOW THAT DOESN?T HAPPEN/DID BCB JUMP THE SHARK? and yeah that doesn?t happen WHAT IS THIS DEGRASSI</p><p>hello i?m explaining the joke because i don?t want people to think i would have actually done such a dumb thing WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR</p>"

(haven?t said that before!)</p><p>This was intended to be the final chapter for a good while, which I know sort of leaves it as an open-ended downer ending. I had these events (December, the play, events behind the scenes) planned for ages and how it was going to happen, and while I know what happens next, I was in a state of mind months ago where I felt this particular chapter could be a ?good? place to finish the series.</p><p>But that?s irrelevant now, thank you for being so encouraging and giving me the energy to keep going and get to the ending planned all along! Will take a long time and there are plenty of side-stories I always wanted to tell, but after the next chapter the tone will change. Hope you can stick around and experience it! Thanks very much! We?re reaching the end of the first month where I?ve been updating five days a week!! Wow!!</p><p>(Oliver:) Just a late (2015!) clarification to the comment above, which was unclear and lead to a general understanding that BCB was at one point supposed to end here, on this page. That isn?t true, as the chapter was thumbed out before that idea was ever floated. Veronica felt like giving up on a lot of things at the time and went through a period of thinking ?Wouldn?t it be funny to end it here, on such a sour note? Maybe I should.? among other more negative things. I chose to put this update here because I occasionally see people talk about everything after this point being some sort of change-of-mind extension, where it isn?t the case at all.</p>"

He was incredibly supportive to us, and went far out of his way to see us at literally every Australian convention we attended except one. He had many little influences on the comic, helping with proofreading our book drafts, sorting comments, and just generally being a super nice guy who was always looking for ways to support this comic.

This is how the web works now, and (we think!) it?s for the better.</p><p>We?ll facilitate the process where we can. <strong>We?re soon adding a section below each page that?ll help you find conversations and contribute your own.</strong> We?ve worked to stimulate discussion over on Tumblr <a href=\"http://bittersweetcandybowl.tumblr.com/\">with our blog</a>, we?re looking into doing more on Facebook, and we?re always open to talk to you guys <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SuitCase874\">through</a> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Taeshi\">Twitter</a>. Notably, <strong>we plan to highlight reader comments we encounter (we?ll keep reading!) and share them prominently when we find them.</strong></p><p>But, ultimately, this is us letting go and handing over the reins to you guys. We believe in you!</p><p>A sincere thank you from the two of us for the many years of wonderful comments ? don?t stop now!</p>"

				"description": "<p>Okay, guys. I have some awkward news to share with you all.</p><p>Basically I?ve been landed with a heavy amount of work, which doesn?t help as Souppy and I are soon to go to Australia to visit his family (from early December until late January) and this was organised months and months ago. (It?s not like I chose to take a vacation while multiple things were being flung at me ;_;) I figured it?d be smooth sailing at the time the flights were booked, but things got in the way. These pages have been taking much longer to complete than before (approx. two days a page as opposed to one page a day during the watercolour days), so my buffer has slowly died. It?s amazing how the longer I?ve been making the comic, the longer it takes to complete a page. Man, the days when it used to take 15 minutes a page.. then 1 hour.. then two hours, then 5 hours, then 7 hours, then a day, now two days :-[ THESE CATS ARE NEEDY.</p><p>Anyway, the goal I have for this month is to finish art and dialogue edits for Volume Four. It?s very difficult as it requires watercolours and readjusting things to be consistent, and doing that while updating with a tiny comic buffer felt impossible.</p><p> We considered shifting to an intermission that would last until the middle of January while I worked on Golden Hour on the side, but I felt that would be wayyyyyyy too long a ?hiatus? for you guys, especially during a pretty important chapter where shit is going down. I know a lot of webcomic artists do cool intermissions or even take breaks, but I just.. I dunno, I feel really bad at the idea of doing that to you. I wanted to be able to keep you following the story without any breaks, so I came up with the idea to post BCI-quality pages as you see above.. I can crank out this style easily, and since I?m using the thumbnails from Golden Hour to do it so you?re basically seeing how it WILL be told (Save angle changes and backgrounds and more care put into it generally hahahah).</p><p>The next chapter will proceed in the regular style. I will work during December and January to avoid any need for intermission or hiatus while still finishing these pages to a higher standard.</p><p>I hope you can understand. I am terribly sorry about this and I feel awful about having fallen behind, but making a book and juggling other projects will do that to you I guess, as well as seeing Souppy?s family who we haven?t seen since 2011 and I love them very much. I?m sorry to those I have disappointed, but I really will try to catch up as fast I can, and you will see Golden Hour?s real pages eventually.</p><p>Thank you so much for your support. I want Volume Four to be awesome! Thanks so much and I hope you guys can stick around with me!!</p><p>tl;dr: Pages will look crappier for a few months because I am busy</p>"
