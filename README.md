# Unofficial BCB Reader for Android
## About
The unofficial Bittersweet Candy Bowl reader app for Android!
This project was started in my free time, and originally the code was meant to be only visible to me.
This means the code can be messy and some details are not explained well (because I know them on the top of my head).
If you're interested in contributing and you have any questions, recommendations, complaints, etc. feel free to let me know or create an issue.

## Is this app in the Play Store?
I intend to launch this app on the Play store some day, but I'd like to make the app open source as well.
Right now I can't decide on a open source license so as of now, so the code in this project probably ~~won't be visible~~ will only be visible to a select few until the app is released.

## Can I download the app from somewhere else?
After every milestone (and sometimes completely randomly) a new file is placed in this directory:
https://static.jeroenhd.nl/bcb/app/releases/
Download and install that. **The app should be considered unstable and just for testing untill it reaches the Play Store!**
